# Learning Hub
Herein lies a growing collection of programming-related tutorials that I've personally engaged with and found helpful. These will cover topics ranging from full-stack and data sci, to low-level systems and game dev, and everything in between! The majority of these resources are _YouTube_ videos, and while I acknowledge that YouTube may not be the _best_ place to learn programming, I do see value in them as launch pads. I also understand that, above all else, **projects** and **work experience** are what _really_ matter, so that's where my focus will continue to be. 

## Prerequisites
A basic understanding of web development concepts and a familiarity with programming fundamentals will be nice while scrounging through the repo!

## Setup
You probably don't want to clone this, it's pretty chunky.
