// JavaScript can be used for web/mobile apps, real-time networking apps, command-line tools, and browser-based games!
// The code runs on browsers (each with JavaScript engine to execute JS code: called "SpiderMonkey" (in FireFox) and "v8" (in Chrome))
// Fun fact: Node.js is v8 (Google Chrome's open-source JavaScript engine) embedded in a C++ program; therefore, now we can run JS outside of browser (backend)!

// ECMAScript is a specification/standard; nowadays we use ES2015/ES6
